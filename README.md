# steam-id-checker
a basic python steam ID checker

requires beautifulsoup, requests:


`pip3 install beautifulsoup4 requests`

# How the config.txt works
The first line of config.txt denotes the name/path of the input file, second line denotes the name/path of the output file. 


If you do not update these 2 lines, the program will not work (unless you hardcode it into the program for some reason).

I made this in about 5 minutes and will not be updating, but feel free to do whatever you'd like with the src :)
